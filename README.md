# robsondle

Custom fullstack implementation of the wordle game.

## About

Robsondle is a personalized clone of the
[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) logic game. 80% of
the app was made more or less in 4 hours during a feastful drinking binge at
Elektron student house. The implementation is not greatly complicated and
innovative, but it was enough to pass 2 courses at uni.

## Quick start

### Docker

The easiest way to run the app is by using Docker.\
In the root directory of the project run the following command:

```sh
docker compose build && docker compose up
```

Now open the app in the [browser](http://localhost:2137/).
